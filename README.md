# Tic-Tac-Toe üïπÔ∏è

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic-Tac-Toe" (also known as Noughts and Crosses) written in both **Java** (with graphical interface) and **Swift** (with text-based interface). It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

The project includes two versions:

- **Java_Tic-Tac-Toe**: A graphical game built using Java Swing.
- **Swift_Tic-Tac-Toe**: A text-based game built using Swift for the terminal.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay**: Play as "X" or "O".
- **Graphical interface (Java version)**: Beautiful UI with buttons for each grid cell.
- **Text-based interface (Swift version)**: Terminal-based gameplay.
- **Win detection**: The game detects when a player wins or when the game results in a draw.
- **Restart option**: After a win or draw, the game can be restarted.
